# Security_Engineer_Interview_Questions

I spent a couple hours the spring of 2016 reading through Glassdoor.com to see what users submitted for security questions they'd received while interviewing for security engineer jobs. I wrote down all of them that weren't duplicates and that's what you've got: raw job interview questions. These are apparently the same questions asked by Google, Salesforce, LinkedIn, etc.

I purposefully didn't map the question to a company. That's not the point of this repo. Learning is.

Security is difficult to get your arms around, much less your brain. I sorted the questions into logical topic groups, though. I'm also answering the questions periodically at https://medium.com/@theporkskewer.

There's also a blog post about how these questions arose from imposter syndrome: https://theporkskewer.medium.com/beginners-mind-vs-imposter-syndrome-996c6a2d2ffa

If you find value in this list of questions, please consider making a donation to the [HS]2 (https://hs2.crms.org/our-impact/) program at the Colorado Rocky Mountain School. It prepares cohorts of first-generation and/or low-income inner-city students of color to succeed in college by empowering them with STEM-based skills, a family of driven peers, and a space to see the light and power in their own voices in an amazing outdoor environment they ordinarily have no access to. Even $1 helps by demonstrating broad support to larger institutions considering donations.
